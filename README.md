Education Website - Machine Learning & DevOps (Angular)
This project is a dynamic and interactive education platform built with Angular, designed to offer comprehensive courses and downloadable resources on Machine Learning and DevOps. It aims to provide a structured learning path for individuals looking to deepen their knowledge in these cutting-edge fields.

Features
Course Catalog: Explore a wide array of courses covering various aspects of Machine Learning (e.g., supervised learning, deep learning, NLP) and DevOps (e.g., CI/CD, containerization, cloud infrastructure).

Course Details Pages: Detailed information for each course, including curriculum, learning objectives, prerequisites, instructor profiles, and student reviews.

Learning Progress Tracking (Placeholder): Basic functionality to track user progress through courses (frontend simulation; no backend persistence for this demo).

Resource Library: Access a curated collection of downloadable e-books, whitepapers, code samples, and supplementary materials related to ML and DevOps.

Search Functionality: Easily find specific courses or resources using keywords.

User Authentication (Placeholder): Basic user registration and login forms to access premium content (frontend only, no actual authentication logic or backend integration for security).

Responsive Design: Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Technologies Used
Angular: The robust framework powering the single-page application.

TypeScript: Ensuring code quality and type safety throughout the development process.

Angular CLI: For efficient scaffolding, development, and building of the Angular application.

RxJS: For handling asynchronous data operations and reactive programming patterns.

HTML5 & CSS3 (with SASS/SCSS): For structuring the content and applying modern styling.

Tailwind CSS (or chosen alternative like Bootstrap/Material Design): For responsive and utility-first styling, enabling rapid UI development.

JSON Server (for mock API): Used during development to simulate a backend API for courses and resources.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

Angular CLI:

npm install -g @angular/cli

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/angular-ml-devops-education.git
cd angular-ml-devops-education

Install NPM packages:

npm install

(Optional) Set up a mock API with JSON Server if you wish to extend functionality locally without a real backend:

npm install -g json-server
# Create a db.json file with your mock course/resource data
# Example db.json structure:
# {
#   "courses": [
#     { "id": 1, "title": "Introduction to Machine Learning", "description": "...", "category": "ML" },
#     ...
#   ],
#   "books": [
#     { "id": 1, "title": "DevOps Handbook", "downloadUrl": "...", "category": "DevOps" },
#     ...
#   ]
# }
# Start JSON Server:
# json-server --watch db.json

Usage
To run the application in development mode:

ng serve

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.

Build
To create a production-ready build of the project:

ng build

The compiled and optimized artifacts will be saved in the dist/ directory.
